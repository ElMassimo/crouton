## Installation

    gem install 'crouton'

## Usage

Simply require `crouton` in your javascript and css:

``` javascript
//= require crouton
```

``` sass
@import 'crouton';
```

Then, use the `render_crouton` method in your controllers, any option you pass
will be converted to a message.

``` ruby
class PostsController < ActionController::Base

  def update
    if @post.save
      render_crouton notice: 'Saved'
    else
      render_crouton errors: @post.errors
    end
  end
end
```

Finally, find a good spot in your HTML for the Crouton, and add the
`.crouton-placeholder` CSS class in the container of choice.

```html
<div class="content crouton-placeholder">
  ...
```

## Customization
Three styles are supported out of the box: __info__, __warning__ and __danger__.
The duration of each message is 1500, 2000 and 3000 respectively.
